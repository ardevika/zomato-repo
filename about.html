        Zomato

Zomato (/zoʊmɑːtoʊ/) is an Indian multinational restaurant aggregator and food delivery company. It was founded by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah in 2008.[5] Zomato provides information, menus and user-reviews of restaurants as well as food delivery options from partner restaurants in more than 1,000 Indian cities and towns, as of 2022–23.[6] Zomato rivals Swiggy in food delivery and hyperlocal space.

History
Zomato was founded as FoodieBay in 2008 by Deepinder Goyal and Pankaj Chaddah who worked for Bain & Company. The website started as a restaurant-listing-and-recommendation portal. They renamed the company Zomato in 2010 as they were unsure if they would "just stick to food" and also to avoid a potential naming conflict with eBay.[7][8][9]

With the introduction of .xxx domains in 2011, Zomato also launched zomato.xxx, a site dedicated to food porn.[10] Later in 2011, Zomato officially launched an online ticketing platform for events.[11]

In 2011, it expanded across India to Delhi NCR, Mumbai, Bangalore, Chennai, Pune, Ahmedabad and Hyderabad.[12] In 2012, it expanded operations internationally in several countries, including the United Arab Emirates, Sri Lanka,[13] Qatar,[14] the United Kingdom,[15] the Philippines,[14] and South Africa.[16] In 2013, it expanded to New Zealand,[17] Turkey, Brazil, and Indonesia, with websites and apps available in Turkish, Portuguese, Indonesian, and English languages.[18] In April 2014, it was launched in Chile and Portugal, which was followed by launches in Canada, Lebanon, and Ireland in 2015.[19][20][21]

In January 2015, Zomato acquired Seattle-based restaurant discovery portal Urbanspoon, which led to the firm's entry into the United States and Australia.[22] This U.S. expansion brought Zomato into direct competition with similar models such as Yelp and Foursquare.[22]

In an effort to expand its business beyond restaurant listing, Zomato started its food delivery service in India in 2015,[23] initially partnering with companies such as Delhivery and Grab to fulfill deliveries from restaurants that did not have their own delivery service.[24]

In April 2015, Zomato acquired the American online table reservation platform NexTable, which was subsequently renamed Zomato Book.[25] In January 2016, it launched Zomato Book's table reservation feature on its application in India.[26] In April 2015, it acquired cloud-based point of sale (PoS) company MapleGraph Solutions,[27] and, in April 2016, launched its own version of PoS for restaurant owners called Zomato Base, comprising menu and inventory management, payment system, and analytics.[28] Later that year, Zomato acquired Sparse Labs (renamed Zomato Trace) and integrated the latter's real-time delivery location tracking technology on its food delivery platform.[29]

In February 2017, the firm announced plans to launch Zomato Infrastructure Services, a cloud kitchen infrastructure service to help partner restaurants expand their presence without incurring any fixed costs.[30] Later that year, it introduced a paid membership program called Zomato Gold using which subscribers could get offers and discounts on dining and food delivery at Zomato's partner restaurants.[31]

In 2018, Zomato shut down operations of Zomato Infrastructure Services.[32] The company then acquired WOTU and rebranded it as Hyperpure to supply food ingredients such as grains, vegetables and meat to restaurants from its warehouses.[33][34] In December 2018, Zomato launched its annual multi-city food and entertainment carnival called Zomaland.[35]

In March 2019, Zomato sold its UAE food delivery business to Talabat.[36] In September 2019, the firm laid off almost 10% of its workforce (540 people) tending to back-end activities like customer service, merchant and delivery partner support functions.[37]

In April 2020, due to a fall in food delivery and rising demand for online grocery ordering amid the COVID-19 pandemic, Zomato began delivering groceries and essentials under a service named Zomato Market in 80+ cities across India.[38] In April 2020, it introduced contactless dining at its partner restaurants.[39] In May 2020, Zomato also began delivering alcohol in West Bengal, Jharkhand and Odisha after obtaining the permission of the governments in these states.[40] In May 2020, Zomato further laid off 520 employees due to the COVID-19 pandemic.[41]

Zomato closed operations of Zomato Market in June 2020 as demand for food delivery recovered and grocery delivery business "was not scalable".[42] In April 2021, it pulled out of alcohol delivery service citing poor unit economics and scalability.[43]

In July 2021, Zomato went public, opening its initial public offering at a valuation of over US$8 billion.[44]

In November 2021, Zomato ceased its services in all countries except India and the United Arab Emirates.[45]

In April 2022, Zomato launched a pilot of 10-minute food delivery in Gurgaon called Zomato Instant.[46] In June 2022, Zomato announced the acquisition of quick-commerce company Blinkit for US$568 million.[47]

In August 2022, Zomato launched a service called Intercity Legends in Delhi NCR that allowed users to have food delivered from famous restaurants in other cities within a few days.[48] In November 2022, Zomato introduced Zomato Pay feature, which allowed users to make payments at partner restaurants and avail offers, and partner restaurants to promote themselves.[49]

Circa February 2023, Zomato ceased operations in Australia, while announcing that their operations in India and the UAE were continuing.[50]

In June 2023, Zomato launched a feature that enabled users to build carts from up to four restaurants and place the order together.[51] In October 2023, the company started offering hyperlocal package delivery service on a separate app called Xtreme.[52]
